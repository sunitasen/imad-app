                    My eyes opened,yet still blank from within,blurry vision,fan hanging above.Mind Desparetely started searching for connection.Within a millisecond,blurry vision cleared,thoughts of previous night flooded within me.Excitement rushed through my vein and popped me out of my bed.
                    <br/>
                    Didi was still lying on the bed.I opened the windows, i felt the wind entering the room,calm and sweet.The sun was half awake,it was yet to shine.I looked down on the empty streets, those street dogs were already chanting there charols.I turned back, mumma was standing in front of me, she raised her eyebrow. I blushed!Showcased my complete set of teeths and hugged her. yes, I was damn excited!
                    <br/>
                        I started brushing.Took the paper lying on my desk and stood in front of the mirror,to test my speech.All I could do was smile.I knew,i will not mess up this time.I was confident,for the first and last time.I regret that!
                    <br/>
                        Back to back three phone calls. They were not specificully the urgent ones. But everyone was so damn excited afterall. It took me two hours,I repeat Two hours to get ready.Draped myself in a saree,which was decided after the suggestion of esteem panel of geniuses,my girl pals.I was looking mesmerizing. Yeah,I am boasting.Shifting from homeless vagabond attire to this pretty look was indeed mesmerizing.
